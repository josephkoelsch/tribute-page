          <h2>Mathematical Contributions</h2>
            <p>Most of Mirzakhani's work was focused on the abstract mathematics of moduli spaces and Reimann Surfaces. She studies shapes like donuts and double-donuts to create models to predict the path of an object as it traveled through this space. </P>
